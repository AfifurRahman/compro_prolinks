							<h3>Tech Infrastructure Assessment</h3>
							<p>Before any integration or transformation can occur, it's crucial to assess the existing technological infrastructure of both the acquiring and the acquired entity. This includes understanding current software, hardware, networks, cloud platforms, and cybersecurity measures.</p>

							<h3>Data Management & Analytics</h3>

							<h3>Cloud Strategy</h3>
							<p>Cloud computing is revolutionizing how businesses operate, offering scalability and flexibility. Post-acquisition, businesses might need to reassess their cloud strategy – whether it's a shift from on-premises to cloud, choosing between different cloud providers, or optimizing current cloud operations.</p>
